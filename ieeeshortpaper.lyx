\begin_layout Abstract
Datacenter networks allow the operation of Internet services by partitioning
 requests to multiple servers, and aggregating results back to form the
 response sent to the users.
 This requires servers within the datacenter to communicate efficiently
 and rapidly.
 Services, differentiated by their workload profiles, require a network
 that can guarantee high throughput, and low flow completion time.
 To achieve these, this paper focused on the effects of Multipath TCP (MPTCP)
 as a transport protocol in the context of datacenters, by making better
 use of the network topology.
 In addition, changes in the packet forwarding protocol within network switches
 and the Generic Offload Receiver (GRO) layer within network servers were
 employed, providing increased reordering resiliency, to make up for MPTCP's
 undesired behavior within datacenters such as network link hotspots.
 With this, the researchers hypothesized an increase in throughput and decrease
 in the flow completion time.
 To test this, a simulated datacenter environment was created tweaking flow
 types, network traffic conditions, switch behavior, transport protocol,
 and host-based reordering resiliency.
 Link throughput and goodput, as well as flow completion time and mean network
 utilization was then measured.
 Analyzing the data, the study found that packet spraying turned out to
 be generally beneficial for the network in terms of all metrics (throughput,
 goodput, flow completion time, and mean network utilization).
 The change in the GRO layer, on the other hand, provided mixed results.
 By simply comparing the means, a simulated network with traffic designed
 to be close to an actual data center generally performed better in all
 metrics with switches that perform packet spraying, as well as MPTCP-enabled
 servers with the GRO layer modification.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Common topologies in datacenter networks exhibit symmetry and path diversity

 This ensures that multiple paths of equal costs exist between two end-hosts

 In addition, an ideal datacenter network must guarantee high throughput
 for large flows, and low latency for short flows

\begin_layout Standard
Multipath TCP (MPTCP), an experimental protocol by the IETF, is a TCP extension
 that uses multiple paths over many connections 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ford2013tcp"

\end_inset

.
 By using multiple paths simultaneously, MPTCP aims to increase network
 utilization, specifically throughput, and increase "resilience of connectivity"
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fordmptcpslides"

\end_inset

.
 This is done by employing Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "raiciu2011improving"

\end_inset

, a switch-based forwarding algorithm.
 ECMP hashes subflows into separate paths using the packet's header information.
 However, hotspots in the network may occur when flows are hashed to paths
 with one or more links overlapping with each other 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "al2010hedera"

\end_inset

, usually exceeding the link capacity.
 Because of this, the network experiences a drop in network utilization
 due to sender backoff

\begin_layout Section
Review of Related Literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Random packet spraying, an alternative to ECMP, can be used to resolve hotspots
 as it allows for a greater granularity for load balancing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "he2008toward"

\end_inset

.
 However, this can result in packets that come out-of-order at the receiver,
 triggering false retransmissions upon receipt of three duplicated packet
 acknowledgements 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ford2011architectural"

\end_inset

, in addition to drastically reducing sender throughput 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "zhang2003rr"

\end_inset

.
 This can be minimized by dynamically changing the retransmission threshold.
 However, a positive mismatch on the threshold may mean a slower response
 time for actual packet drops 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "zhang2003rr"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minimizing retransmission due to out-of-order packets can be done by supplementi
ng the function of the Generic Receive Offload (GRO) layer to fix the order
 of packets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "geng2016juggler"

\end_inset

 in addition to merging packets together.
 This not only reduces computational overhead compared to per-packet processing,
 but makes the end-hosts more tolerant to packet reordering, and thus reduces
 retransmissions.
 However, reordered packets must arrive within a short delay of each other
 since the switch queues are limited and timeouts are smaller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, to maintain backwards compatibility with TCP, MPTCP also suffers from
 the complexity in connection establishment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dixit2013impact"

\end_inset

 and slow start 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "stevens1997tcp"

\end_inset

, which in turn penalizes short flows through higher flow completion times.
 To maintain lower flow completion times and lower latency for short flows,
 a specified amount of packets are sprayed through multiple paths initially
 before switching to MPTCP 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kheirkhah2016mmptcp"

\end_inset

.
 However, this means that it inherits problems from both implementations
 altogether.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Better network utilization can be also achieved using Software-Defined Networkin

 with MPTCP.
 With a global view of the network, it can better utilize path diversity,
 have a better gauge on the number of subflows per connection, and ideally
 minimize the receipt of out-of-order packets.
 This solution benefits large flows, but due to the added controller overhead,
 it may penalize short flows.
 In addition, it may also have some scalability issues

\begin_layout Standard
To combat delay and lower throughput caused by multiple timeouts on wireless
 networks, retransmission redundancy was implemented using full and partial
 bicasting over MPTCP 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fukuyama2016throughput"

\end_inset

.
 This may not necessarily be effective in the datacenter setup as redundant
 packets may cause more false retransmissions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Problem Statement and Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An increase in datacenter network performance (higher throughput, lower
 flow completion time) is ideal not only for the company but for its users
 as well.
 Employing MPTCP in a network alone will bring a comparable difference compared
 to TCP (higher throughput due to its use of multiple paths), however it
 comes with its drawbacks (longer flow completion time due to connection
 establishment complexity; appearance of network hotspots).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The researchers hypothesized that an increase in overall throughput and
 network utilization in MPTCP can be achieved through implementing packet
 spraying in the network instead of ECMP.
 Since packet spraying can introduce an eventual decrease in throughput,
 the researchers hypothesized that this can be mitigated by creating reorder-res
ilient end-hosts.
 By comparing the results we see from different experiments, the basis for
 considering a reorder-resilient network for future datacenter networks
 can be strengthened, as well as have the results potentially contribute
 to the growth of MPTCP as an experimental protocol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objectives of this work were as follows: First was to experimentally
 prove that MPTCP benefits large flows, but penalizes short flows.
 Next was to understand and prove that network hotspots occur due to ECMP-based
 switches.
 Lastly, observe and analyze the effects of packet spraying switches, as
 well as reorder-resilient hosts, to minimize network hotspots, and in turn
 benefit both short and large flows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope and Limitation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project focused on datacenter networks, and assumed ideal working conditions.
 More specifically, this project did not consider the possibility of switch
 failures, host failures, link damages that could cause degradation of performan
ce or even disconnections.
 Among datacenter topologies, only fat tree topologies and possible variants
 were considered.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the nature and topology of datacenter networks are highly distinct
 from the vast majority of the Internet, or wide area networks (WANs), the
 results and observations presented in this paper may potentially apply
 to WANs as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As this paper relied heavily on experiments done through network simulations,
 this project cannot guarantee the realization of actual or realistic datacenter
 network traffic, but tests were made to mimic certain datacenter network
 conditions such as worst-case scenarios.

Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Validating the Behavior of MPTCP Path Managers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Preliminary work was executed to investigate the performance between three
 out of four MPTCP path managers (default MPTCP, 
\family typewriter
fullmesh
\family default
 MPTCP, and 
\family typewriter
ndiffports
\family default
 MPTCP) compared to the performance of TCP.
 Based on the results, TCP had the fastest flow completion time out of the
 four, being beneficial to short flows.
 
\family typewriter
Fullmesh
\family default
 MPTCP achieved the highest throughput overall, being able to take advantage
 of multiple paths, making it ideal for large flows.
 However, it had the slowest flow completion time, which may be attributed
 to extra packets being sent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Building the Test Environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mininet was chosen to orchestrate the virtual network, its switches, and
 its hosts.
 It ensured that all virtual hosts are running on the same configuration
 as the server it was running in.
 This allowed the researchers to implement multiple changes at once.
 The network topology was generated programmatically, and switch behavior
 was swapped through configuration files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MPTCP was available as an ns-3 model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kheirkhah2014ns3"

 or a kernel patch

.
 Juggler 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, which modifies the GRO function to increase packet reordering resiliency,
 was only readily available as a kernel patch.
 Since the experiments required hosts that needed both features, a custom
 kernel was prepared with the MPTCP kernel and Juggler kernel merged together.
 This was then applied to the server to virtualize certain hosts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Switches, on the other hand, were described with its normal forwarding algorithm
, which stores only one next-hop for all destinations in its routing table.
 The switches were also capable of Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP), and Packet
 Spraying (PS), which required a routing table storing multiple next-hops.
 Since these forwarding behavior require inspection into packet headers
 and metadata, we utilized and modified software switches enabled by P4,
 a programming language used to process packets

Setting up the Network Topology

For this study, the fat tree topology was chosen because it was a common
 and scalable data center network topology.
 Like all DCN topologies, the fat tree topology provides several equal cost
 paths between any two end-hosts.
 Moreover, because the topology maintains its symmetry regardless of its
 size, a Mininet topology can be easily set up with unique addressing

Network Traffic Conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tests were done in two simulated network conditions/setups.
 The first condition assumed a network without any activity, allowing for
 two hosts to communicate using all of the available resources of the network
 (hereinafter referred to as a 
\family typewriter
silent network
\family default
).
 The second condition assumed some form of simulated traffic, comparable
 to the performance in a live network (hereinafter referred to as a 
\family typewriter
noisy network
\family default
).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 
\family typewriter
silent network
\family default
, host pairs took turns at sending data to each other, without any other
 activity in the network.
 Pairs were chosen by random, ensuring that all hosts became a server or
 client at some point.
 The clients requested a payload of certain size from the server (this defined
 the flow type), one after another.
 This request was then repeated a certain number of times.
 The designations were fixed for each iteration of the test.
 The payload transfer was done through a network bandwidth measurement tool
 named 
\family typewriter
iperf
\family default
.

In the

, two hosts requested data from multiple hosts at the same time, polluting
 the network with activity.
 For a fat tree topology with 
\begin_inset Formula $K=4$
\end_inset

, this meant that the network was split between two groups, with each having
 one client chosen at random, and seven chosen to be servers.
 Like the 
\family typewriter
silent network
\family default
, designations were fixed for each iteration of the test.
 This behavior mimics the partition-aggregate design pattern of DCNs

In both network conditions, multiple server-client pairs were used to obtain
 a thorough assessment of the different links in the network.
 Analysis was done through inspection of the packet capture output of Mininet.
 Each test was also repeated to obtain a sufficient number of data points.

Test Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Datacenters cater to requests of varying sizes.
 To have an approximation of these requests and how they affect the performance
 of the changes to the network stack, we included the option to test with
 different flow types, done by defining payload sizes.
 Three flow types are to be used and tested for these experiments: 
\family typewriter
query
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
short
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
long
\family default
 (previously referred to as

As a baseline comparison for the improvements of MPTCP, a TCP option was
 included in the testing environment.
 These results can serve as a control group for the comparison of the performanc
e of MPTCP as a protocol.
 In addition, the performance of the changes in the network stack with TCP
 as its transport protocol was also measured and analyzed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Performance Metrics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Packets were aggregated to flows (based on the 5-tuple) and were grouped
 together by links.
 By tracing the links traversed by flows between two end-hosts, the following
 were discovered: the unique shortest paths used, the total amount of bytes
 transferred within the interface associated with the flow, and the time
 it took for the flow to complete.
 This allowed for the following performance metrics to be derived.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Throughput and Goodput
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughput was to be the rate of the bytes transferred between two hosts
 in the network (i.e., total bytes transferred in all flows / flow completion
 time).
 In contrast, goodput was the rate of the actual data (only the size of
 the payload) transferred over a period of time (i.e., payload size in bytes
 / flow completion time).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison between goodput and throughput can be used to indicate how
 much overhead affects the rate of transmission of actual data.
 If throughput is higher than goodput, this can be an indication to the
 presence of added MPTCP headers or packet retransmissions.
 This translates to no perceptible improvement from the perspective of the
 hosts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Flow Completion Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flow completion time was defined to be the amount of time that a request
 between two hosts took to complete.
 This included the first request packet sent from the client to the server
 and the last 
\family typewriter
FIN
\family default
 packet sent from server to the client.
 For instances with multiple flows, the flow that took the longest time
 to complete was considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An increase in flow completion time can be attributed to the overhead of
 connection establishment (for MPTCP), packet retransmissions, and/or 
\family typewriter
ACK
\family default
 timeouts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Mean Network Utilization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this paper, mean network utilization was considered to be the ratio
 of used links between two hosts.
 Knowing both used and unused unique shortest paths, mean network utilization
 was considered to be maximized if all interfaces with the smallest number
 of bytes transferred per path had about the same value.
 For example, if two end-hosts with four unique shortest paths between them
 used only one path out of four, the mean network utilization will be 25%
 (0.25).

\begin_layout Standard
There were two independent variables: the switch behavior combined with
 the underlying transport protocol (
\family typewriter
ecmp-mptcp
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ps-mptcp
\family default
), as well as the inclusion/non-inclusion of Juggler (
\family typewriter
juggler
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
vanilla
\family default
 respectively).
 There were six test clusters, grouped by network traffic conditions (
\family typewriter
silent network
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
noisy network
\family default
), permuted with the three flow types/payload sizes (query, short, long).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were four dependent variables pertaining to the performance metrics
 discussed previously: throughput, goodput, flow completion time, and mean
 network utilization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each test cluster was subjected to a two-way MANOVA to verify the significance
 of the differences, and the performance of the independent variables were
 ranked via comparison of means.
 In addition, a comparison of percent differences of goodput and throughput
 was executed to inspect the effects of hotspots in the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another experiment which included TCP tests serving as control groups (the
 addition of 
\family typewriter
static-tcp
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
ps-tcp
\family default
 to the existing switch behavior-transport protocol pairs) was also executed.
 For the majority of the next chapter however, the experiments discussed
 MPTCP tests only.

\begin_layout Section
Results and Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A proper multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) meets the following
 assumptions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "noauthor_how_nodate"

\end_inset

: dependent variables should be continuous, independent variables should
 consist of two or more categorical groups, there should be independence
 between observations, and there should be a sufficient number of data points.
 These four assumptions were met by virtue of the experimental setup.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other assumptions for MANOVA not listed above, if unmet, reduce the validity
 of the results.
 Some tests did show that the data set did not meet some of these assumptions,
 which meant that the following results should be interpreted with reservations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Tests of Between-Subjects Effects and Best Performing Independent Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A confidence interval of 95% (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0.05$
\end_inset

) was chosen to determine the significance of the various test groups.
 For this chapter, focus is given solely on the tests of between-subjects
 effects.
 The independent variables with the highest mean for outcomes that had a
 significant result were then identified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a given link in the network, bandwidth was limited to 20 Mbps.
 Tests within a silent network, specifically for throughput, goodput, and
 flow completion time were mostly inconclusive.
 This may be attributed to the nature of the silent network–with all configurati
ons able to maximize the network capacity, the results may turn out with
 little difference with each other.
 With the throughput and goodput for a given flow for all configurations
 naturally reaching the bandwidth cap, flow completion time may not differ
 greatly between setups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Gap Between Goodput and Throughput as an Indicator of Network Hotspots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Network hotspots, defined as switches that have links that are near to exceed
 their capacity, result in an increase of dropped packets and increased
 packet retransmissions.
 This results in an increase in flow completion time, as well as the total
 amount of bytes transferred.
 Therefore, a significant gap between throughput and goodput may be noticed
 if network hotspots are in the network.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this experiment, the observed means of goodput and throughput for statically-
configured switches (with hosts running TCP), ECMP-based switches (with
 hosts running MPTCP), and PS-based switches (with hosts running TCP and
 hosts running MPTCP) were taken.
 The percentages of traffic in excess of the actual flow size were then
 calculated.

\begin_layout Standard
The results show that statically-configured switches had significantly less
 excess traffic over both ECMP-based switches and PS-based switches for
 query and short flows.
 However, during long flows, the difference between all the switch behaviors
 seemed insignificant.
 In all cases, ECMP-based switches and PS-based switches (with hosts running
 MPTCP) performed comparably equally, implying that packet spraying did
 not mitigate the hotspot problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By assuming that excess traffic correlates to multiple retransmissions and
 the presence of hotspots, increasing the number of paths used may not always
 result in an increase in goodput especially if these paths shared common
 links (i.e., hosts only had one interface connected to the entire network,
 resulting in clogs).

Flow Completion Time Performed Worse with Reorder-Resilient Hosts; Inconclusive
 Effects on Throughput
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the results, Juggler had a negative effect on flow completion time
 as well as goodput for a silent network with query and short flows, as
 well as for a noisy network for short flows.
 The increase in false retransmissions may be attributed to Juggler where
 at times, it may have incorrectly bundled MPTCP packets as if they were
 TCP packets, as MPTCP was built on top of TCP 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, with its own separate system of determining the order of packets.
 This may also explain the inconclusive results for throughput.
 Results were mixed, with Juggler increasing throughput for short flows
 (on both silent and noisy networks), but failing to increase throughput
 for query flows on a silent network and long flows on a noisy network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Packet Spraying Generally Performed Better than ECMP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the switch behavior, packet spraying performed better than ECMP in
 all significant cases.
 It increased mean network utilization for all test groups compared to ECMP,
 and it performed mostly better than ECMP for goodput, throughput, and flow
 completion time tests in a noisy environment.
 This behavior may be preferred as most datacenter networks are high in
 network activity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Effects of Combining Packet Spraying-based Switches with Reorder-Resilient
 Hosts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Studying the combined interaction of both switch behavior and reorder-resiliency
 led to less significant results.
 Packet spraying without the Juggler modification increased goodput for
 query flows on a silent network (1.65% greater than ECMP without the Juggler
 modification), and for short flows on a noisy network (1.38% greater than
 packet spraying with the Juggler modification).
 Interestingly, ECMP with the Juggler modification increased goodput for
 long flows on a silent network (1.01% increase versus packet spraying with
 the Juggler modification).
 Packet spraying with the Juggler modification, on the other hand, increased
 throughput for long flows on a silent network (4.27% increase versus ECMP
 without the Juggler modification), and short flows on a noisy network (21.84%
 increase versus ECMP with the Juggler modification).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Packet spraying without the Juggler modification decreased the flow completion
 time for query flows on a silent network (1.70% decrease versus ECMP without
 the Juggler modification), and short flows on a noisy network (1.86% decrease
 versus ECMP without the Juggler modification).
 In addition, it also increased the mean network utilization for long flows
 on a silent network (0.15% increase versus packet spraying with the Juggler
 modification).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By visually comparing the results, ignoring all measures of statistical
 significance, it can be seen that that a noisy network with packet spraying
 and the Juggler modification provided a more desired performance in all
 four metrics (througput, goodput, flow completion time, and mean network
 utilization).
 Packet spraying and the Juggler modification also improved the mean network
 utilization in all cases.
 On the other hand, if flow completion time were to be prioritized (where
 the majority of the flows can be classified as query flows or short flows),
 the network may be better off without the Juggler modification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion and Recommendations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on preliminary tests, MPTCP increased throughput significantly compared
 to TCP, especially whenusing multiple paths.
 However, the connection establishment overhead needed to create multiple
 subflows penalized the speed at which flows are created and consequently
 completed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the paper promised to experimentally prove that ECMP-based
 switches causes hotspots in the network.
 As a basis for comparison, two network traffic conditions designed to mimic
 both the best case (silent network) and worst case (noisy network) scenarios
 were used.
 By comparing the throughput and goodput of ECMP-based switches without
 reordering resiliency, it can be seen that that there were no improvements
 to the hotspots in the network.
 However, hotspots in the network may be a consequence of the experiment
 setup.
 This could either be attributed to the amount of traffic in the noisy network
 or due to the limited bandwidth at the single interface of the host for
 both network setups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was also found that packet spraying generally improved all four metrics
 (throughput, goodput, flow completion time, and mean network utilization)
 for a noisy environment.
 However, inspecting the effects of the GRO layer modification (Juggler)
 had mixed results.
 Comparisons including the combined effects of both the switch behavior
 and Juggler turned out with less statistically significant results, however
 when this is ignored, packet spraying and Juggler-modified hosts provided
 a more desired performance in all metrics (goodput, throughput, flow completion
 time, and mean network utilization) for noisy networks.
 Considering that most datacenters will, more often than not, operate with
 a lot of concurrent flows in the network, packet spraying (tied with the
 GRO layer modification) may be beneficial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Recommendations and Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further analysis may be done on TCP combined with packet spraying and reorder
 resilient hosts.
 According to initial testing, TCP with reorder resilient hosts and packet
 spraying showed an increase in throughput and goodput.
 This may be promising as there would be no need to implement a new transport
 protocol in the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for MPTCP, the other path managers can be used and tweaked to gain more
 insights as to how the total number of subflows would affect the performance
 of the different flow types.
 Specifically, an investigation can be done analyzing if incrementing/reducing
 subflows would affect network performance.
 The addition of a flow type classifier as well as an automatic knob on
 the number of subflows can potentially help grow MPTCP as a protocol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further tests can also be done studying network topologies other than fat
 tree, as used in this study.
 Fat tree is commonly preferred due to its cheap and scalable nature, but
 the fact that each end-host is connected to the rest of the network through
 only one interface causes a significant bottleneck, limiting the benefits
 of the network's supposed path diversity.
 It is also possible that different results may arise from having a larger
 fat tree (
\begin_inset Formula $K>4$

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Juggler, the modification to the Generic Receive Offload (GRO) layer, can
 also be investigated further, specifically with its effects on both TCP
 and MPTCP.
 Since Juggler has not been maintained for quite a while now, its kernel
 modifications may have been completely overwritten, skipped, or negated
 by updated kernel patches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Network hotspots may also be studied further by creating a special testbed
 specifically built to measure the amount of traffic going through specific
 nodes in the network.
 In some cases (like in a different network topology), packet spraying may
 still improve network hotspots caused by ECMP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, data collected in a datacenter network with real traffic would be
 beneficial for the validity of the tests since the simulated traffic in
 this experiment was merely an approximation.
