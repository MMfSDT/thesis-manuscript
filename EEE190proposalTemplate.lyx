Datacenter networks allow the operation of Internet services by partitioning
 requests to multiple servers, and aggregating results back to form the
 response sent to the users.
 This requires servers within the datacenter to communicate efficiently
 and rapidly.
 Services, differentiated by their workload profiles, require a network
 that can guarantee high throughput, and low flow completion time.
 To achieve these, this paper focuses on Multipath TCP (MPTCP)  as a transport
 protocol in the context of datacenters, by making better use of the network
 topology.
 In addition, changes in the packet forwarding protocol within network switches
 and the Generic Offload Receiver (GRO) layer within network servers will
 be employed to make up for MPTCP's undesired behavior within datacenters
 such as network link hotspots.
 With this, we hypothesize an increase in throughput and decrease in the
 flow completion time.
 We will test this through a comprehensive analysis of different testbeds
 with varying parameters.
 Initial tests in a smaller network topology show that throughput between
 two end-hosts in a network increases which also implies that network utilizatio
n also increases.
 It was also observed that the overhead of establishing multiple subflows
 in an MPTCP connection using the TCP handshake penalizes short flows.

To keep up with increasing demand for online services, requests and operations
 are usually serviced by partitioning tasks into multiple servers within
 a datacenter.
 These servers are then arranged in a special topology to ensure quick intercomm
unication between each other, regardless of packet stream length or size.
 As a consequence, servers have multiple paths between each other.
 There lies a promising performance benefit by taking advantage of this
 path diversity, in which the traditional transport protocol, TCP, cannot
 provide.

Servicing Increasing Demand with Datacenter Networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several companies and institutions (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, to name
 a few) provide a wide variety of online services such as video streaming,
 online gaming, VoIP, file sharing, and simple web searching.
 These online services usually differ in their workload profiles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "geng2016juggler,he2008toward"

\end_inset

—faster connections result to better performance for file sharing services,
 while connection stability is the main concern for video streaming services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The demand for online services has been increasing steadily due to their
 popularity.
 Moreover, the competitive market have pushed for innovations to improve
 services, resulting in increased computational load 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 To keep up with demand that increases in both quantity and complexity,
 companies need to expand and upgrade their resources, increasing costs
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wilson2011better,decandia2007dynamo"

\end_inset

.
 One way to meet this demand is to distribute service requests to multiple
 servers, then aggregating responses to form the final result (also known
 as the partition/aggregate design pattern) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "alizadeh2010data"

\end_inset

.
 Infrastructures built with this demand distribution property are called
 datacenter networks (DCNs).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from meeting the increasing demand, this provides several benefits.
 Firstly, by having redundant servers, services can be maintained even during
 partial network maintenance

 Secondly, an organized and redundant network infrastructure eases management

Connection-Rich Nature of Datacenter Network Topologies

Partitioned requests are distributed among servers within a datacenter (end-host

 Since majority of the flows stay within a datacenter 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, the network topology must guarantee a speedy and reliable connection between
 local end-hosts.

 means that the server response delays also add up and affect the performance
 of the service 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 End-hosts also need to keep their internal data structures fresh 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 through frequent large transfers of data.
 Therefore, datacenters must also guarantee low latency for short flows,
 and high throughput to service large flows

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While MPTCP promises performance benefits such as increased throughput between
 two hosts, it suffers from problems which hinder or negate its advantages.
 The nature of datacenter network traffic and topology presents two potential
 setbacks for MPTCP.
 First, short packet streams (short flows) might experience a higher latency
 due to MPTCP's connection establishment mechanism.
 Second, large packet streams (large flows) might suffer from lower throughput
 due to MPTCP's congestion and subflow mechanism.
 In addition to the presented solutions to these problems, a closer look
 is given to switch-based packet spraying, combined with host-based reordering
 resiliency, as a potential improvement over MPTCP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Connection Establishment of MPTCP Penalizes Short Flows 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MPTCP, being designed as an extension for TCP 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ford2013tcp"

\end_inset

, inherits its congestion control mechanisms.
 One of which is Slow Start 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "stevens1997tcp"

\end_inset

, where each subflow starts sending a limited amount of packets, then exponentia
lly increases its sending rate until a link capacity/threshold is reached.
 Exceeding link capacity can result to packet loss due to switch overflows,
 making the receiver fail to acknowledge the packet.
 This subsequent action will cause the sender to retransmit the packet due
 to its internal retransmission timeout, or due to receiving three duplicate
 acknowledgements (TCP Fast Retransmit) for a previously sent packet, in
 addition to reducing the sending rate of the sender.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since majority of the flows on a datacenter are short flows 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "greenberg2009vl2"

\end_inset

 and are of a bursty nature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "alizadeh2010data"

\end_inset

, MPTCP would cause these flows to stay in the Slow Start phase 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "barik2016lisa"

\end_inset

, where the sending rate is initially limited, then is increased drastically.
 Therefore, when short flows lose packets due to congestion, retransmission
 is necessary, and this increases the flow completion time 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kheirkhah2016mmptcp"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, MPTCP also inherits TCP's handshake protocol, in order to create
 and establish subflows between end-hosts.
 Since MPTCP cannot discern between short and long flows, it cannot decide
 as to how many subflows should be established to optimally send packets
 across the network.
 Therefore, a mismatch in the number of subflows, specifically for short
 flows would further increase the flow completion time due to the extra
 packets required to establish a connection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To minimize the flow completion time for short flows, connections can start
 by spraying packets over multiple paths.
 Connections then can switch back to MPTCP upon reaching a certain amount
 of packets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kheirkhah2016mmptcp"

\end_inset

, to make use of MPTCP's benefits over long flows such as increased throughput
 and better congestion control.
 However, the introduction of packet spraying in addition to using MPTCP
 would open this specific implementation to both problems associated with
 each.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Decreased Throughput due to Redundant Retransmissions 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MPTCP uses Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP), a switch-based algorithm, to forward
 packets through the network 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "raiciu2011improving"

\end_inset

.
 ECMP bases its forwarding on a 5-tuple (source IP, destination IP, source
 port, destination port, protocol number) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hopps2000multipath"

\end_inset

 which is hashed and used to forward packets to paths.
 This means that all data belonging to one subflow will strictly follow
 one network path.
 Selected network paths by ECMP may traverse links that have already been
 chosen by another subflow, which will effectively decrease the maximum
 available capacity of the link.
 Areas in the network that are close to exceeding link capacity are called
 hotspots.
 Colliding subflows may exceed the link capacity for any given link in a
 datacenter network, resulting in full switch queues.
 Full switch queues will then lead to dropped packets, which in turn, decrease
 mean network utilization 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Duplicating packets across multiple paths (bicasting/multicasting) in an
 MPTCP connection can be used to mitigate the decrease in throughput due
 to dropped packets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fukuyama2016throughput"

\end_inset

.
 In full bicasting, each connection transmits a copy of all packets sent
 across multiple subflows, while selective bicasting only duplicates packets
 that are sent as a retransmission of lost packets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the increase in throughput for individual subflows brought about
 in both full and selective bicasting may not be optimal in a datacenter.
 This is, in part, attributed to the duplicating nature of bicasting wherein
 redundant data is sent through the network’s links and consumes resources
 for other subflows.
 In addition to redundant data packets, control packets such as the ACK
 packets in TCP add to network traffic.
 This added traffic to the network can be perceived as a loss in throughput.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Diffusing Network Hotspots through MPTCP with Packet Spraying 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As previously mentioned, network hotspots create areas of congestion in
 datacenter networks, throttling the throughput of the connections that
 pass through these hotspots.
 One way to avoid this is to use packet spraying 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dixit2013impact"

\end_inset

.
 Packet spraying spreads a sequence of packets through different candidate
 ports instead of forwarding packets of a single flow through a chosen port
 according to its hashed flow identifier as seen in ECMP.
 This scheme prevents the collision of multiple paths onto specific links
 (hash collision), and spreads the packets in the hopes of evenly distributing
 the load through all relevant links of the network.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, distributing packets of a flow into different paths can lead to
 out-of-order packets if the paths have significantly different end-to-end
 delays 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dixit2013impact"

\end_inset

.
 End-hosts receiving packets that do not arrive in the order that they were
 sent may falsely perceive that the network is lossy and request for retransmiss
ions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "postel1981transmission"

\end_inset

.
 The sending end-host will receive these retransmission requests and will
 falsely perceive that there is congestion in the network, cutting the congestio
n window in half which will then result in the reduction of throughput.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to avoid false congestion due to packet reordering is to adjust
 the time threshold of the end-hosts before they request for retransmission
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kheirkhah2016mmptcp"

\end_inset

, effectively making end-hosts more tolerant to delays in the network.
 However, an improper configuration (mismatch) of this threshold will result
 in an increased delay before sending retransmission requests in actual
 congestion experienced in the network, greatly decreasing the flow completion
 time and penalizing short flows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To increase the resiliency of the end-hosts against out-of-order packets
 while avoiding a threshold mismatch, one solution would be to increase
 the buffer size of the Generic Receive Offload (GRO) layer of the end-hosts
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "zhang2017resilient"

\end_inset

.
 The GRO layer works underneath the transport layer, and is responsible
 for bundling packets to decrease computational overhead versus individual
 per-packet processing.
 Increasing the buffer size enables it to accept packets that arrive earlier
 than those preceding it thereby increasing its resilience towards out-of-order
 packets.
 This is based on the assumption that, in a datacenter, delay differences
 between paths are significantly less than in non-datacenter networks.

Drawbacks Caused by MPTCP with a Global View

\begin_layout Standard
With Software Defined Networking (SDN), a global view of the network state
 can be provided to a central controller 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This enables network protocols to make use of global network information,
 such as link utilization and end-to-end delays 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, to create more informed decisions.
 SDN approaches have introduced several benefits to MPTCP, such as increased
 throughput and network resiliency, by controlling the number of subflows
 and scheduling the routes of different connections to avoid both network
 hotspots and out-of-order packets

These benefits, however, comes at the price of controller overhead 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hussein2017sdn"

\end_inset

.
 SDN controllers need to communicate regularly with the network switches
 in order to issue forwarding rules to adapt with the situation, causing
 delays.
 Since most congestion events that happen in datacenter networks are because
 of traffic bursts that only lasts for a few microseconds (microbursts)
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ghorbani2017drill"

\end_inset

, controller overhead becomes significant, and so SDN implementations cannot
 respond fast enough.
 Due to controller overhead, SDN implementations can also increase the flow
 completion time of connections, penalizing short flows.
 Moreover, SDN implementations generally do not scale with a large number
 of connections as the controller overhead also increases with the number
 of active connections

Common topologies in datacenter networks exhibit symmetry and path diversity

 This ensures that multiple paths of equal costs exist between two end-hosts

 In addition, an ideal datacenter network must guarantee high throughput

Multipath TCP (MPTCP), an experimental protocol by the IETF, is a TCP extension
 that uses multiple paths over many connections 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ford2013tcp"

\end_inset

.
 By using multiple paths simultaneously, MPTCP aims to increase network
 utilization, specifically throughput, and increase "resilience of connectivity"
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fordmptcpslides"

\end_inset

.
 This is done by employing Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "raiciu2011improving"

\end_inset

, a switch-based forwarding algorithm.
 ECMP hashes subflows into separate paths using the packet's header information.
 However, hotspots in the network may occur when flows are hashed to paths
 with one or more links overlapping with each other 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "al2010hedera"

\end_inset

, usually exceeding the link capacity.
 Because of this, the network experiences a drop in network utilization
 due to sender backoff

\begin_layout Standard
Random packet spraying, an alternative to ECMP, can be used to resolve hotspots
 as it allows for a greater granularity for load balancing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "he2008toward"

\end_inset

.
 However, this can result in reordered packets at the receiver, triggering
 false retransmissions upon receipt of three duplicated packet acknowledgements
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ford2011architectural"

\end_inset

, in addition to drastically reducing sender throughput 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "zhang2003rr"

\end_inset

.
 This can be minimized by dynamically changing the retransmission threshold.
 However, a positive mismatch on the threshold may mean a slower response
 time for actual packet drops

Minimizing retransmission due to out-of-order packets can be done by supplementi
ng the function of the Generic Receive Offload (GRO) layer to fix the order
 of packets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "geng2016juggler"

\end_inset

 in addition to merging packets together.
 This not only reduces computational overhead compared to per-packet processing,
 but makes the end-hosts more tolerant to packet reordering, and thus reduces
 retransmissions.
 However, reordered packets must arrive within a short delay of each other
 since the switch queues are limited and timeouts are smaller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, to maintain backwards compatibility with TCP, MPTCP also suffers from
 the complexity in connection establishment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and slow start 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "stevens1997tcp"

\end_inset

, which in turn penalizes short flows through higher flow completion times.
 To maintain lower flow completion times and lower latency for short flows,
 a specified amount of packets are sprayed through multiple paths initially
 before switching to MPTCP 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 However, this means that it inherits problems from both implementations
 altogether.

 with MPTCP.
 With a global view of the network, it can better utilize path diversity,
 have a better gauge on the number of subflows per connection, and ideally
 minimize the receipt of out-of-order packets.
 This solution benefits large data flows, but due to the added controller
 overhead, it may penalize short flows.
 In addition, it may also have some scalability issues

To combat delay and lower throughput caused by multiple timeouts on wireless
 networks, retransmission redundancy was implemented using full and partial
 bicasting over MPTCP 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fukuyama2016throughput"

\end_inset

.
 This may not necessarily be effective in the datacenter setup as redundant
 packets may cause more false retransmissions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We hypothesize that an increase in overall throughput and network utilization
 in MPTCP can be achieved through implementing packet spraying in the network
 instead of ECMP.
 In addition, creating reorder-resilient end hosts will combat the negative
 effects of packet spraying such as decreased throughput.
 By comparing the results we see from different experiments, we strengthen
 the basis for considering a reorder-resilient network for future datacenter
 networks, as well as potentially contribute to the growth of MPTCP as an
 experimental protocol.

Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objectives of this work are as follows: First is to experimentally prove
 that MPTCP benefits large flows, but penalizes short flows.
 Next, understand and prove that network hotspots occur due to ECMP-based
 switches.
 Lastly, observe and analyze the effects of packet spraying switches, as
 well as reorder-resilient hosts, to minimize network hotspots, and in turn
 benefit both short and large flows.

\begin_layout Section
Scope and Limitation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project will focus on datacenter networks, and assume ideal working
 conditions.
 More specifically, this project does not consider the possibility of switch
 failures, host failures, link damages that could cause degradation of performan
ce or even disconnections.
 Among datacenter topologies, only fat-tree topologies and possible variants
 will be considered.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the nature and topology of datacenter networks are highly distinct
 from the vast majority of the Internet, or wide area networks (WANs), the
 results and observations presented in this paper may potentially apply
 to WANs as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As this paper relies heavily on experiments done through network simulations,
 this project cannot guarantee the realization of actual or realistic datacenter
 network traffic, but tests will be made to mimic certain datacenter network
 conditions such as worst-case scenarios.

\begin_layout Standard
Considering that Multipath TCP (MPTCP) penalizes short flows due to unnecessary
 overhead due to connection complexity, as well as creates hotspots due
 to ECMP routing, the metrics to be observed should be flow completion time,
 and end-host throughput, for short and large flows respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To characterize the behavior of the routing protocol, the end-hosts, and
 the network, we execute a number of tests varying different parameters
 related to each.
 The control group would have end-hosts running TCP without any kernel or
 network stack modifications.

 Preference is then given to kernel patches, assuming that there are little
 to no conflicts between both MPTCP and Juggler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Switches, on the other hand, can be described with its normal forwarding
 algorithm, which stores only one next-hop for all destinations in its routing
 table.
 However, the switches must also be capable of Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP),
 and Packet Spraying (PS), which require a routing table storing multiple
 next-hops.
 In consideration, the switch must be capable of the three previously described
 algorithms, with preference to easier switch customization.

\begin_layout Section
Preliminary Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further understand the current implementation of MPTCP on servers, smaller
 tests were used and characterized.
 As the protocol is still in active development, a lot of parameters are
 available to play around it, resulting in different performances.
 Future work might focus on automatically setting these parameters to optimally
 cater to the network activity, completely transparent to the user.

Managing Multipath TCP Subflows

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the default path manager does not initiate nor announce different
 IP addresses, but will still accept subflows from end-hosts that do.
 Next, the full mesh path manager creates flows using all combinations of
 interfaces (device within end-host to connect to links 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "coltun2008rfc"

\end_inset

) of both end-hosts (i.e.
 assuming all interfaces correspond to unique IP addresses, two end-hosts
 with three interfaces each will have 9 subflows).
 Finally, the N-different-ports path manager allows the control over the
 number of subflows in a connection through the use of different ports.
 The fourth path manager called binder, isn't considered as it was designed
 for mobility of devices, a trait not present in datacenter networks.

, assuming all links are rated at 10 Mbps (i.e., the minimum supported transmissio
n rate of both devices connected to the link is 10 Mbps), we expect to see
 TCP, Default MPTCP, and Ndiffports MPTCP to have a sender rate of 10 Mbps,
 whereas Full Mesh MPTCP can have a sender rate of up to 20 Mbps.
 This is because the first three would only use 1 IP address pair, and thus
 is limited to 1 subflow.
 But, the Full Mesh MPTCP establishes four subflows, because both hosts
 have two available interfaces, fully utilizing all possible links.
 This was validated experimentally and the results are shown in Table

However, more subflows utilized sometimes may come at a cost.
 For short flows, opening multiple subflows may not be necessary, as the
 packets may have already been sent even before a new subflow has been establish
ed.
 To prove that MPTCP does indeed introduce some overhead for short flows,
 the flow completion time was measured between TCP, Default MPTCP, and Full
 mesh MPTCP.

This experiment once again uses the topology in Figure

.
 The left host (h1) will request for the web page from the right host (h2),
 which has a web server running.
 The web page to be fetched is a default directory index page, and because
 the web server sends a stream of small packets to complete the request,
 it counts as a short flow.
 The tests were ran 10 times with TCP, Default MPTCP, and Full Mesh MPTCP,
 and the flow completion time (FCT) were noted.
 We defined the flow completion time as the time difference between the
 first SYN packet up to the last ACK packet for the last FIN packet.

.
 Here, we see that TCP has the fastest flow completion time.
 As Default MPTCP works much like TCP, but has an added establishment overhead
 over TCP, it has a slower flow completion time.
 Lastly, since Full Mesh MPTCP opens multiple subflows while transmitting
 data, packets for connection establishment of other subflows compete for
 the same available links, resulting in the slowest flow completion time.
 In addition, since flows are terminated like TCP connections, extra packets
 are sent to terminate all open subflows before finishing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the topology considered for the previous experiments is relatively simpler
 compared to actual datacenter topologies, we hypothesize that the observed
 behavior will still hold true, and the effects are amplified to a certain
 extent.

Data Gathering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scripts will be programmed with the use of network performance tools to
 properly gauge the throughput, and flow completion time.
 The different network setups will then be evaluated using the measured
 performance metrics, and validated by replication on another testbed running
 on a separate device.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the effects of implementing MPTCP and packet spraying in datacenter
s, a network will be emulated using Mininet with end-hosts configurable
 to run TCP or MPTCP, and network switches configurable to run ECMP or Packet
 Spraying.
 Next, end-hosts will be configured with and without Juggler.
 These changes will be weaved together to form multiple setups with varying
 configurations.
